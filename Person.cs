 We haven't covered namespaces yet. Think of them like Python modules. 
 In Python, you might write:

   from SchoolRecordsAssignment import Person

 In C#, to use the Person class from the SchoolRecords namespace, you write:

   using SchoolRecordsAssignment;

 Namespaces help organize code and prevent name conflicts.

        // Constructor:

        // Method:

        // NOTE: Method just means a function inside a class.
